How to change priorities of network routing (for example eth over wlan):

nmcli connection modify <connection name> ipv4.route-metric 1

Instead of 1 you can take any number ( the lower the number, the higher the priority)
To get connection name type: nmcli connection

Useful Commands: "v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext" -> see which resolutions and fps are supported
"c4l2-ctl --list-devices"

Possible configuration for camera (using H.264):
-format: NV12 -res: 1920x1080 ->fps: 30 without imwrite, 28 with
-format: MJPG -res: 1920x1080 ->fps: ~20 without imwrite
-format: YUYV -res: 1920x1080 ->fps: 30 without imwrite, 25 with
-format: MJPG -res: 1280x720 ->fps: ~46 witout imwrite, 37 with 
-format: MJPG -res: 640x480 ->fps: 90 with/without imwrite

With overlocking (@2Ghz arm freq):
format: MJPG -res: 1280x720 -> fps: 50fps without imwrite, ~40 with

With overlocking (@2.1Ghz arm freq):
format: MJPG -res: 1280x720 -> fps: 53fps without imwrite, ~41-44 with

crop frame:
	top corner: x=363, y= 70
	square side length = 600

White balance settings (only works whit lighting):
	"v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl white_balance_temperature=3500"
	"v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl white_balance_automatic=0"

PID paramaters:
	Okay performance and relatively fast but steady state error: kp = 3.5, ki = 1.5, kd = 0.55, alpha = 0.3
	relatively slow but smaller steady state error: kp = 3.5, ki = 0.3, kd = 0.43 alpha = 0.3
	Best so far: Very fast and no steady state error: kp=3.5, ki = 0.3, kd = 0.33

Frequency for PWM Signal:
	For PID control of the angle of the plate its better to use 500 Hz instead of 1000Hz (More smooth)

To measure potentiometers many times a second: 
	Set it to continuous mode using "ads.mode = ADS.Mode.CONTINUOUS". This sets the ADC to always read the input value at a specified rate and the putting the result into
	a register than can be read at anytime and very quickly. However using this method we can only connect one potentiometer. So we need two ADCs.	

Inner Loop Parameters: Kp =7, Ki = 0.6, Kd = 0.66

Best parameters for circle tracking: Kp = 20, Ki = 0, Kd =0.1, vel_factor = 15
Best parameters for center regulation: Kp = 20, Ki = 6, Kd = 1

Establish ssh connection to Raspberry Pi: 
	1. Open Windows Powershell terminal
	2. Type "ssh guest@192.168.1.3"
	3. Press space for the password and enter
	4. To disconnect: Type "exit" in the terminal
